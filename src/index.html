            <h3 class="display-5"> About the Project </h3>
            <p>Our project allows you to take the Big Five Personality Test and see how your answers compare to others' responses as you answer each question. There are already many websites where you can take the Big Five Personality Test for free, but none of them have information about how the average person answers each question. If you would like to take the test for more detailed results, <a href="https://bigfive-test.com">this website</a> offers a free and open-source test with results.</p>
            <p>When you click on an answer choice, it will be replaced with a percentage. This represents the percentage of people in the dataset who responded with that answer, and you will also be able to see the corresponding percentages for the other answer choices as well.</p>
            <h3 class="display-5"> About the Test </h3>
            <img src="https://www.verywellmind.com/thmb/tUq6cQchqWEgN_2G5r9RAl9gmHg=/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/2795422-article-the-big-five-personality-dimensions-5a9083fb6edd650036603137.png" style="height: 400px; width: 600x;">
            <p>The Big Five Personality Test measures five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each question measures one of these five categories, and your overall score in each category will determine where you fall within the possible range of values in that category.</p>
            <p>For example, a low overall score on the questions that measure openness indicates that you're practical, conventional, and prefer routine, while a high openness score would suggest that you are curious, independent, and have a wide range of interests. Below is an infographic with the equivalent attributes associated with each of the Big 5 personality traits:</p>
